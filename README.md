# Sea Level Predictor

This project is part of the freeCodeCamp Data Analysis with Python certification. It involves analyzing a dataset of the global average sea level change since 1880 and using it to predict the sea level change through the year 2050.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to use Python to analyze historical sea level data and predict future sea levels through linear regression. The project tasks include:

- Importing data using Pandas.
- Creating a scatter plot of the sea level data.
- Calculating the line of best fit using the `linregress` function from `scipy.stats`.
- Plotting the line of best fit over the scatter plot.
- Extending the line of best fit to the year 2050 to predict future sea level rise.
- Plotting a new line of best fit from the year 2000 to the most recent year in the dataset.

## Development

The main script for the project is `sea_level_predictor.py`. This script contains the code to perform data analysis and visualization.

## Testing

Unit tests are provided in `test_module.py`. These tests will check the correctness of the data analysis and ensure that the visualization meets the project requirements.

## Data Source

The dataset used in this project is the Global Average Absolute Sea Level Change, 1880-2014, provided by the US Environmental Protection Agency using data from CSIRO, 2015; NOAA, 2015.

## Visualization

The resulting visualization will display the historical sea levels and the predicted levels up to 2050.
